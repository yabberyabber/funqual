\chapter{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

The following things are not handled correctly by the tool but it would be cool if they were:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item struct fields
    \item casting of function types
    \item arrays of function pointers
\end{enumerate}

future work should implement these features.
