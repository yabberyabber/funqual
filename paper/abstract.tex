In this paper we create a static analysis tool called funqual.  Funqual reads C++17 code "in the wild" and checks that the function call graph rollows a set of rules which can be defined by the user.  We demonstrate that this tool, when used with hand-crafted rules, can catch certain types of errors which commonly occur in the wild.  We claim that this tool can be used in a production setting to catch certain errors in code before that code is even run.
