\section{Glibc Nonreentrant Functions}

The following functions are documented in glibc to be non-reentrant:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item malloc
    \item free
    \item printf
\end{enumerate}

There are others.  We can mark interrupt handlers as one class and these functions as another and statially check that.

\section{Restricting API available during initialization}

My OS project was annotated so I didn't accidentally call malloc or printf before those things were initialized

\section{Detecting noisy calls in high frequency contexts}

Robotics was annotated and checked so I didn't accidentally have printf's in high frequency functions.
