\chapter{Application}\label{sec:application}

This chapter demonstrates three real use-cases for funqual.  In each section below, we outline the application of funqual to a project, the constraint that funqual was used to enforce, and the outcome of using funqual to check that constraint.  \mbox{Section \ref{sec:app:reentrancy}} describes using funqual to prevent reentrancy errors in a class assignment for Operating Systems at Cal Poly (CSC453).  Section \ref{sec:app:pre-malloc} describes using funqual to prevent use of \lstinline{malloc} and \lstinline{printf} during boot-up of a custom kernel written in a class assignment for Operating Systems 2 at Cal Poly (CSC454).  Lastly, \mbox{Section \ref{sec:app:blocking}} describes using funqual to prevent the use of potentially blocking calls in high frequency loops in a robotics application.  

All of these projects were developed before funqual existed, so funqual was not used during the development cycle.  The goal of this chapter is to demonstrate that funqual can scale beyond small test cases and to demonstrate how funqual can be used to address a variety of real-world issues.
